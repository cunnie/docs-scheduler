This topic describes how to install and configure Scheduler.

##<a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

Before you install Scheduler v1.4, you must have one of the following:

+ A VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs v2.7 or later tile with **TLS Options** set to **Optional** or **Not Configured**. To download VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs, see [VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-mysql/) on VMware Tanzu Network. For information about installing VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs, see [Installing and Configuring VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/install-config.html). For information about configuring TLS options, see [Configure Security](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/install-config.html#security).

+ An external MySQL database with TLS disabled.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Scheduler is compatible with VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs. Compatibility with MySQL alternatives like MariaDB is not tested or guaranteed.</p>

## <a id="download-install"></a> Download and Install Scheduler

1. Download the product file from [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-scheduler).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of Scheduler.
  This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly added **Scheduler** tile.

## <a id="config-tile"></a> Configure Scheduler

Follow the steps below to configure the Scheduler tile.

###<a id="azs"></a> Configure AZs and Networks

Follow the steps below to choose an Availability Zone (AZ) to run the Scheduler Service Broker and to select networks.

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Configure the fields as follows:

    <table class="nice">
      <tr>
        <th>Field</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Place singleton jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select the AZ for executing the Scheduler Errands. All Scheduler components execute as apps and do not require VMs.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Balance other jobs in</strong></td>
          <td>Ignore this field.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select a subnet for the Scheduler Errands. Use the subnet that includes the VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) component VMs.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>: The network selected is used only by Errand VMs and does not apply to the Scheduler runtime.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

###<a id="scheduler-config"></a> Configure Scheduler Options

1. Click **Scheduler Configuration**.
    * **Enable outbound HTTP calls**:
      This field is enabled by default. Disable this feature to prevent users from scheduling
      outbound HTTP requests (calls) from the Scheduler service. This does not affect
      outbound connectivity from Diego tasks (jobs).
    * **Database Source > Service Broker**:
      * **Name**
        Enter the name of your MySQL service broker. For example, `p.mysql`.
      * **Plan Name**
        Enter the name of your MySQL service plan, which is used to provision a database for
        persistent storage of Scheduler data, including jobs, calls, and history. For example,
        `db-small`.
    * **Database Source > External**:
        Enter a database URL. It must have a scheme, user, password, host, and port, for example
        `mysql://user:password@db.example.com:3306`. Query parameters are ignored. For example, with
        `mysql://user:password@db.example.com:3306/?useTLS=false`, the query parameter `useTLS` is
        not propagated to Scheduler.
