This documentation describes Scheduler.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Scheduler is a service for scheduling the execution of Diego tasks (jobs),
such as database migrations, emails, or batch jobs, as well as the execution of outbound HTTP
requests (calls).

Scheduler enables developers to do the following:

* Create, run, and schedule jobs and view job history.
* Create, run, and schedule calls and view call history.

You can interact with the service through the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI),
[Apps Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/console/manage-apps.html#enable-scheduling),
and the [Scheduler HTTP API](https://docs.pivotal.io/scheduler/api/).

## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements

Scheduler requires a MySQL database.

You can use either of the following:

+ VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs v2.7 or later. See [VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/index.html)
+ An external MySQL database

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

* If your app uses a buildpack that does not generate a `web` process type,
such as Ruby or Python, you should do the following:
<br><br>
    1. Before pushing your app, create a
    [Procfile](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/buildpacks/prod-server.html#procfile)
    in the root directory of the app.
    2. Declare a `web` process type in the file.

    If you do not declare this process type, your app will not be accessible through
    the cf CLI after you create Scheduler jobs for it.

* The maximum number of tasks that you can schedule is determined by the memory
and disk quotas in the Scheduler org and space.
For more information, see [Running Tasks](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/devguide/using-tasks.html#manage-tasks).
