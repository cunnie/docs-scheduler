VMware recommends backing up your VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs database before installing Scheduler v1.4.

To back up your VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs database, see [Manual Backup](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/backup-restore.html#manual-backup).

For general information about upgrading a tile, see [Upgrading Ops Manager Products](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/upgrading-products.html#other-products).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> All <strong>Post-Deploy Errands</strong> must be enabled
