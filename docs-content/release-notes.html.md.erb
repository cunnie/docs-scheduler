## <a id="database-transactions"></a> Database Transactions in Scheduler v1.4.0

Scheduler v1.4.0 includes a significant change to its operation: database
transactions. Scheduler's database has several interdependent tables; in
previous releases, it was possible under certain circumstances for records in
those tables to go out of sync. This could result in jobs that did not run and
could not be deleted.  Now, with database transactions enabled, the tables will
stay in sync.

An implication of this change is that the scheduler may have a delay of up to 5 seconds
before executing a job or call. This is because the creation of the scheduled job
occurs within a transaction that is not yet visible to the scheduling thread.
