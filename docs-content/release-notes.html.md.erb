### <a id='internal-property'></a> Internal database_source.external.url Property is Secret

Users of the `pivotal-cf/om` GitHub repository or Platform Automation will
see an error message similar to the following:

```json

'mysql://user:password@example.com:3306' type String, expected Object"]}}
```

To fix the issue, update your product configuration by running:

```diff

   .properties.database_source:
     selected_option: external
     value: external
   .properties.database_source.external.url:
